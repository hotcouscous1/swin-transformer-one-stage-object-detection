# Swin Transformer + BiFPN + YOLO V5

In this repository, we present a new structure of one-stage detection model based on Swin Transformer. There are official and other repositories adopting Swin Transformer as the backbone of the model, but what's new here is;
* BiFPN instead of FPN
* YOLO V5 스타일의 bbox regression and head? predictor?
* focal loss
